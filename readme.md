# Copy2Clipboard

Copy2Clipboard is a simple app that let's you create files that, when opened, automatically copy whatever is in it to your clipboard. Really useful to keep in your desktop.

## Usage

- Create a file with a different extension that won't be recognised by any other program (I personally use .c2c)
- Save inside of it whatever text you want to be copied upon opening
- Open the file
- When Windows prompts you with which app you want to open the file just browse and select the executable of Copy2Clipboard
- Done!
